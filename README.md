The printf family of functions in the C programming language are a set of functions that take a format string as input among a variable sized list of other values and produce as output a string that corresponds to the format specifier and given input values. The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters. The design has been copied to expose similar functionality in other programming languages.
